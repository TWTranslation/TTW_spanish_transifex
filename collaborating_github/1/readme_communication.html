They are the first thing new visitors to your project will see and thus are part of a set of really important documents to make potential contributors feel welcome and invite them to get involved.
Your <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/">README file</a> should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you are doing, for who, and why.</li>
<li>What makes your project special and exciting.</li>
<li>How to get started.</li>
<li>Where to find key resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>An <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/">Open Canvas</a> can be a good tool to help you clarify what you want to achieve with your project and what you should cover in your README.</p>
