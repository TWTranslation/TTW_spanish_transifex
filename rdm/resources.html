<ul>
<li><p>[ ] Don't Touch the Raw Data - back it up somewhere reasonable and keep a read-only copy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Have a plan! - Decide where your data is going to be stored, what its called, when/if it needs to be deleted</p>

<pre><code>BEFORE you start collecting it and note it down in a data management plan. If you collect sensitive data, plan for
consent for sharing from the start!</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Document Everything - You know who the worst person at replying to emails is about what the sampling frequency of</p>

<pre><code>channel X was. Nope not him, it's actually yourself from a year ago. Keep the documentation with the data!</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Create the data you want to see in the word - Imagine someone was about to give you a dataset that you needed to</p>

<pre><code>analyse well in order to get that job you've been dreaming about. What would you want it to look like? That's how
yours should look.</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Try not to re-invent the wheel. Before you start creating some crazy new schema, storage format or naming</p>

<pre><code>protocol - have a quick google, ask your colleagues. Something that's already being used is likely going to be
better in the long run even if you think there's a better solution. &lt;a name="What-Next"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
