Too little and your software is unsustainable; too much and you won’t be able to Get On With It. It can take just a few seconds, but gets you off on the right foot.</p>
<h2 id="Longer-read&#8230;">Longer read&#8230;<a class="anchor-link" href="#Longer-read&#8230;"> </a></h2><p>We all use risk assessments all the time. Sometimes they’re formal procedures to ensure an activity is safe, but most of the time they’re the thought of a moment- Is this coffee too hot? Is there a bus coming? Software is no different, and using a risk assessment approach like the one described below can really help make your work successful and sustainable.</p>
<h3 id="The-risk-matrix">The risk matrix<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-risk-matrix"> </a></h3><p>A risk matrix is a very popular way of quantifying what’s going on with the thing you’re interested in. One axis measures exposure in some way, and the other the impact of a mishap. The further from the origin, the more safeguards are needed to make the risk acceptable.</p>

<p>In our case, we will use ‘complexity’ and ‘impact’ as the two axes. Some case studies illustrate how it works…</p>
<p>Case 1</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard needs to submit a 100 small jobs to the department cluster, with the names of the jobs varying according to a simple pattern. This is tedious and he wants to go outside and play. Therefore, Richard decides to write a short shell script to submit all the jobs. He pauses for a few seconds and asks:</p>
<p>How complicated is this? It’ll only be about 1 screen of text.</p>
