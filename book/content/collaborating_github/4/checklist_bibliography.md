## GitHub contributor section as your checklist

GitHub encourages collaboration practice in their community guidelines. 
The insights tab of your GitHub project provides a section called "Community" that includes a list of recommended documents that your project should have.
Those include a README, Code of Conduct, Contributing guidelines, licence, and templates for issues and pull requests.
