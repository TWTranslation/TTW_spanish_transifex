## Checklist

<!-- This is a different style than the other chapters, but I really love what Alex provided so I just kept it. -->

- [ ] Don't Touch the Raw Data - back it up somewhere reasonable and keep a read-only copy.

- [ ] Have a plan! - Decide where your data is going to be stored, what its called, when/if it needs to be deleted
      BEFORE you start collecting it and note it down in a data management plan. If you collect sensitive data, plan for
      consent for sharing from the start!

- [ ] Document Everything - You know who the worst person at replying to emails is about what the sampling frequency of
      channel X was. Nope not him, it's actually yourself from a year ago. Keep the documentation with the data!

- [ ] Create the data you want to see in the word - Imagine someone was about to give you a dataset that you needed to
      analyse well in order to get that job you've been dreaming about. What would you want it to look like? That's how
      yours should look.

- [ ] Try not to re-invent the wheel. Before you start creating some crazy new schema, storage format or naming
      protocol - have a quick google, ask your colleagues. Something that's already being used is likely going to be
      better in the long run even if you think there's a better solution. <a name="What-Next"></a>

## What to learn next

If you haven't read the chapters on Open Research and Credit yet, you might want to read it now for more context on how research
data management supports Open Research and how these practises can result in getting attribution for your work (Credit). <a name="Further-Reading"></a>
