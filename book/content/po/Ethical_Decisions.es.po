msgid "Society continually debate the use of animals in scientific research. "
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:8
msgid "The fundamental questions are whether experiments using animals are morally justifiable and whether the potential benefits outweigh the suffering of those animals?"
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:9
msgid "These questions have been coupled with increasing concern about the poor reproducibility of findings from animal research, due to the impact this has on translation, scientific progress and the use of resources."
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:10
msgid "A question that is not often addressed is how those justified experiments are designed, conducted and analysed."
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:11
msgid "Flawed experimental design, inappropriate statistical analysis and inadequate reporting have been flagged as areas for major concern (Kilkenny et al., 2009 (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007824), Begley et al., 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.303819))."

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:13
msgid "If the results are unreliable then the animals used have in effect have been wasted (Ioannidis et al., 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62227-8), de Vries et al., 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar/ilu043)).  "

msgid "The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) have a freely accessible web-based tool – The Experimental Design Assistant (EDA; https://eda.nc3rs.org.uk) which aims to help researchers improve the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of animal experiments."
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:23
msgid "Designing experiments with the EDA encourages researchers to consider the sources of bias at the design stages of the experiment before the data are collected, ensuring a rigorous design that is more likely to yield robust findings that can be reproduced."
msgstr ""

#: Ethical_Decisions/Planning_Research.md:24
msgid "The tool ensures that you have a transparent, clear protocol and plan for statistical analysis which can be scrutinised before collecting data.  "
