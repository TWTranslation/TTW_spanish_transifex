# unordered list
msgid "- **Avoiding disaster**: By working reproducibly, you can trust your own research results and will not have to retract published results or keep publications back because you cannot reproduce your results."
msgstr ""

#: reproducibility/02/whycare.md:6
# unordered list
msgid "- **Writing papers easier**: Well documented analyses ensure that you have easy access to the latest results, your work can easily be written up, and collaborators can easily get on board as additional authors."

The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.
