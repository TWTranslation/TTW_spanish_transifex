## What to learn next

We recommend reading the chapter on testing, and then the chapter on continuous integration. Note that the chapter on version control is a prerequisite for the chapter on continuous integration. The open research chapter also contains further information on sharing research reproducibly.

## Further reading

The [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) contains a lot of information about containers in general.

## Definitions/glossary

**Binder:** A web-based service which allows users to upload and share fully-functioning versions of their projects in an environment they define.

**Computational environment:** Features of a computer which can impact the behaviour of work done on it, such as its operating system, what software it has installed, and what versions of software packages are installed.

**Conda:** A commonly used package management system.

**Container:** Lightweight files that can encapsulate and entire computational environment including its operating system, customised settings, software and files.

**Dockerfile:** A file used for creating Docker images

**Image:** Files used for generating containers.

**Package management system:** A tool for installing, managing, and uninstalling software packages including specific versions.

**Virtual machine:** A simulated computer that can encapsulate and entire computational environment including its operating system, customised settings, software and files.

**YAML:** A human readable/writable markup language which used by many projects for configuration files.
