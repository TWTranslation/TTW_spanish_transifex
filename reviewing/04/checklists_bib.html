<h2 id="Checklists">Checklists<a class="anchor-link" href="#Checklists"> </a></h2><p>The following presents some possible checklists for both the coder and the reviewer, as part of a formal review process.</p>

<h3 id="For-the-coder">For the coder<a class="anchor-link" href="#For-the-coder"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>[ ] Does the new code meet project standards? In particular,<ul>
<li>[ ] Is there documentation?</li>
<li>[ ] Are there new tests for the new material?</li>
<li>[ ] Do these tests pass locally?</li>
<li>[ ] Are you following any declared style guides?</li>
<li>[ ] Are the tests in the rest of the code base still passing locally?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] Create the pull request; wait for any CI checks to complete.</li>
<li>[ ] Consult the CI reports. Did all the builds and tests complete?</li>
<li>[ ] If necessary, now formally request a review.</li>
<li>[ ] Once review is complete, discuss any comments necessary.</li>
<li>[ ] Make the changes, and record the changes made against appropriate comments.</li>
<li>[ ] Check that the reviewer knows you believe you have fully addressed the review.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="for_the_reviewer"></a></p>
<h3 id="For-the-reviewer">For the reviewer<a class="anchor-link" href="#For-the-reviewer"> </a></h3><ul>
<li>[ ] Check the code meets basic project style, if this is not automatically checked by CI.</li>
<li>[ ] Check there are tests &amp; documentation to necessary standards.</li>
<li>[ ] Read the code, carefully.<ul>
<li>[ ] Is all the code easily understood? <!-- Chanuki notes that this has been  added to emphaise the importance of readbilty in code--></li>
<li>[ ] Is it clear what all sections of the code do?</li>
<li>[ ] Are the logic and approach in the proposed changes clear?</li>
<li>[ ] Are the logic and the approach both sound?</li>
<li>[ ] Do the tests actually ensure the code is robust in its intended use?</li>
<li>[ ] Are there any bugs or other defects?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] As needed, engage constructively with the coder if they disagree on certain points in order to come to a consensus.</li>
<li>[ ] Once the coder believes changes are complete, check that they do indeed address all of the initial comments.</li>
<li>[ ] Approve the changes, and if it is your responsibility, make the merge.</li>
