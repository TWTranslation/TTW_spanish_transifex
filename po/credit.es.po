#: credit/credit.md:30
msgid "Reproducible research is great, but spending time on it will reduce the time you have available for activities by which researchers are traditionally measured, such as writing papers. But what if you could get credit for your reproducibility efforts as well?"

#: credit/credit.md:34
msgid "Academic research is a reputation economy, and citations are the currency. Most research institutions' promotion and hiring criteria depend to a greater or lesser extent on your publishing record: how many articles you have published, how \"important\" the journals were, and how many times each article has been cited."
msgstr ""

#: credit/credit.md:36
msgid "This is a well established practice, and while it has its problems at least all stakeholders understand what's involved. One of the consequences of this system is that labour which *doesn't* result in published articles tends to be ignored, discouraging researchers from making their data more open or specialising in software development."
msgstr ""

#: credit/credit.md:38
msgid "Establishing good citation practice for non-article content is a step towards recognising this valuable work and encouraging more people to take it up. If you can demonstrate the impact of your reproducible research work in addition to more traditional research outputs, you can justify spending more time on doing things right."

msgid "There are many reasons why authors don't cite the data and software that they use, but one of the biggest ones is that it's not clear how. You can go a long way to reducing this barrier by following a few steps to make it as easy as possible."

msgid "### Open research"
msgstr ""

#: credit/credit.md:46
msgid "The first step is to ensure that you have something worth citing. Practising open research isn't essential to get credit for your data or software, but it makes it much easier for others to build on your work in a way that acknowledges your contribution. There is a growing body of evidence that shows open research tends to be cited more than non-open research of equivalent quality and significance."

However, it can sometimes help to have a more conventional paper to cite, and this is where software and data journals come in. These journals are similar to methods journals, in that they tend not to include significant results but instead focus on describing data and software in sufficient detail to allow reuse.
