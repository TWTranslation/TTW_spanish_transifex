msgid "As with [testing](#Testing), a key objective of code review is to remove mistakes and bad practice from changes made to a software project before those changes enter the master code base. However, it also has a number of other direct and indirect benefits to projects. These are discussed below."

msgid "A simple objective of the review process is to catch bugs and elementary errors in proposed changes before they make it into the trunk code. In this way, code review shares aspects with testing. However, a robust testing programme should reduce the importance of code review for identifying these kinds of straightforward errors, as the tests should catch them before the code makes it to review stage. So in principle, this function of code review should be restricted to trivial changes like documentation typos. In practice, however, code review does act as an important second line of defence against all kinds of bugs and errors."

#: reviewing/01/how_helpful.md:13
msgid "As noted above, review should, and often does, catch actual bugs in proposed code changes. This, of course, is a sign that the proposed changes were not well-tested enough in the first place. A major aim of code review is to highlight places in the code where existing or newly developed testing processes are inadequate. In this way, code review helps to ensure the future health of the code base by providing a second perspective on what kinds of tests are needed - not only now, but also under hypothetical scenarios that could arise in the future as the code evolves."

Code review provides another pair of eyes to consider whether the documentation provided along with the proposed code changes is fit-for-purpose.

If you're the coder, don't waste your reviewer's time. If you're the reviewer, listen to what the coder is telling you in reply, and work collaboratively with them to make the code better."

These can be particularly useful to guide inexperienced coders to write better code while not being too nitpicky. The coder can then decide to ignore these non-crucial comments if they don't agree.

This means code review is typically a fast, flexible, and interactive process. Good peer review will be fully collaborative, where once a potential query has been flagged by a reviewer, the two involved parties can work forward together to find a solution. It's also not atypical for third parties to chime in during the discussion threads that can grow under more gnarly review comments, either voluntarily or by request. This is all to the good."

msgid "Individual large-scale development projects will likely have existing, concrete rules for how reviewers are allocated to individual pull requests. These rules serve to balance the group workload and to maximise the various benefits of the process to the project and its participants. The very largest projects may even have dedicated staff - or teams of staff - to act as reviewers. In contrast, within small-scale projects where the developers all typically already know each other, typical practice is for the coder to tag someone in the group who they feel will have enough knowledge of this part of the code to do a good job in a reasonable amount of time. In practice, the point of transition between the structured and unstructured models will become very obvious within a growing project - typically when certain members of the core personnel start to complain about the uneven workload for reviewing they are under!"
msgstr ""

#: reviewing/02/best_practice.md:30
msgid "For projects where multiple rounds of review on similar material are likely and long development cycles are anticipated, a degree of strategic thinking on who completes reviews is sensible. A single reviewer is likely to be able to make comments on code they have reviewed before much more efficiently. However, letting reviewer-coder pairs like this ossify is generally a bad idea, as it can lead to the same kinds of groupthink that the review process is designed to avoid in the first place. Individual projects will tend to find this balance for themselves."

The review step occurs between the points where the coder believes their contribution is complete and where that contribution is merged into the trunk code for the project, and so it is intimately associated with a single pull request. Creation of the review and discussion between the reviewer and the coder occurs once the pull request is made and before it is merged into the master.
