msgid "We all use risk assessments all the time. Sometimes they’re formal procedures to ensure an activity is safe, but most of the time they’re the thought of a moment- Is this coffee too hot? Is there a bus coming? Software is no different, and using a risk assessment approach like the one described below can really help make your work successful and sustainable."

msgid "> Richard needs to submit a 100 small jobs to the department cluster, with the names of the jobs varying according to a simple pattern. This is tedious and he wants to go outside and play. Therefore, Richard decides to write a short shell script to submit all the jobs. He pauses for a few seconds and asks:"

msgid "> Jemma has a problem with visualising some data. The usual library can’t cope with the format her data. She’s heard about Seth’s Friday afternoon project where he’s written a wrapper around this library to solve what seems to be the same problem. They have a coffee and decide to work together. During this coffee, they make some decisions about how they’re going to work successfully together- this is their risk assessment. Seth agrees to go away and improve the inline documentation and add some use case examples before sharing. Jemma agrees to set up a repository into which Seth will put the code."

# blockquote, which can be cascaded
msgid "> Over time, more people start to make use of this software, with feature requests adding complexity and changes in the underlying library causing breakages. Jemma and Seth agree that things are getting a bit risky because the impact of wrong results might cause problems with publishing results. They therefore introduce continuous integration tests and a review process to ensure things remain sustainable."

msgid "The key point of these case studies is that every piece of software has different needs to be sustainable, and these requirements can change over time. The use of version control, testing, documentation and other sustainability concepts are useful for managing risk. Using none of these tools leaves your software exposed to things going wrong, but using all of them from the outset can get in the way of innovation."

#: risk_assessment/01/longreadriskassessment.md:35
msgid "One measure of complexity is line count. The more lines you have the more places there are to make a mistake. However, there are other things one might care about. How many libraries do you depend on? How many functions are there? All of these measure the complexity of the codebase."
